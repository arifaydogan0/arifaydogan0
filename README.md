When i was dealing pcb desings and programming processor,i realized that i more like jobs is  coding part. That's why i'm improving myself on high-level programming languages. I started learn C#(actually started to Python for understand OOP dynamics but couldn't get used to that and i moved on to C#.) because of i dealed on the C and C++ before and I developed many projects in .Net environment. Iâ€™m interested in AI, Algoritmic Trade, Web Automation, Micro Processors, and slowly Android..
